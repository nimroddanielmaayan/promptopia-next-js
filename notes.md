- When to use Server and Client Components?
  https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#when-to-use-server-and-client-components

- The default is always server-side rendering. To use client-side rendering, we
  need to specify 'use client' at the top of the page // Client-side rendering
  is neccessary when we we need to apply interactivity, state management or any
  browser API

- App router or pages router? In Next.js 13.4 and later, it's recommended to use
  only the app router

- This app was built using Next.js 13.3.4, but the app router was still
  available as an "experimental" feature in that version

- One of the main differences between a library and a framework (like Next.js)
  is that a framework makes things easier by providing structure, but on the
  other hand, we have to follow the structure's rules
